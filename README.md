# AutomaticCandidateSearch
A Django web-based project to help human resources find best-fitting developer candidate by using language, location, and keyword.

# Goal(s):
Build a Django-based web app that helps us make automated searches from GitHub mainly and extract information, in other words, a candidate's relevant information, 
then stores this information in a PostgreSQL database, using vanilla HTML and javascript and bootstrap CSS on the frontend and display results in simple web interfaces.

# Install the project :
1- Make sure you've installed Django and PyGithub. <br>
2- Make sure you've entered your own Github token.

# Screenshot :
IMPORTANT NOTE : The results below in the screenshot is the result of the different searches done before, not the result of the search in the example !
